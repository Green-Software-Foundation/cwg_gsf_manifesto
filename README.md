# GSF Manifesto

## Scope
>“The Green Software Foundation’s Manifesto”, is the public facing declaration of the policy and aims of the Foundation. It describes the set of core values of the Foundation and how we operationalise those values. It is used to both inform and guide the decisions and behaviours of the people inside the Foundation and signal to external stakeholders what's important to the Foundation.

This document lists the values of the Foundation. Each value has a one-sentence title, a description and some examples for how to operationalise that value.

# Minimise Carbon Emissions 
The Foundation's mission is to reduce real world, physical carbon emissions. When evaluating choices we choose the option that advocates for abatement (reducing emissions) not neutralisation (offsetting emissions).

Operationalise: 
- We will consider how to minimise carbon emissions in every decision we make around how we conduct ourselves operationally and the standards and technology we create and use.

# Maximise Trust
If there is no trust in the Foundation's output, it won't have the influence needed and will fail its core mission. When evaluating choices we choose the option that increases trust in the Foundation.

Operationalise: 
- We will have a diverse mix of organisations, for profits, non-profits, government, and academia.
- We will maintain focus on the goals we set out to achieve to ensure that we make sustainable progress towards our vision. 

# Operate With Integrity 
Integrity is the foundation of making any meaningful change, allowing us to build trust and forge partnerships. 

Operationalise: 
- We will always act with integrity, keeping the core mission of the Green Software Foundation in focus, recognizing that our collective work will only be successful if we operate with a foundational commitment to integrity in everything we do.

# Be Transparent By Default
Transparency builds trust. 

Operationalise:
- Unless there is a good reason to maintain privacy, all documentation, threads, and processes will be open and transparent. (Link to data privacy policy)

# Hold Ourselves Accountable
Accountability builds trust and ensures that all members, stakeholders, and contributors feel that the Green Software Foundation is a community where we uphold our values and ensure safety, professionalism, and inclusion. 

Operationalise:
- We will always assume our colleagues are operating with the best intentions and working towards the Green Software Foundation mission.  In the case that a member of the Green Software Foundation is engaging in any behaviors that are in conflict with our core values, we will escalate the issue to the Steering Committee to be addressed. (Link to code of conduct/escalation policy)

# Provide Direct Feedback
Feedback, when given constructively, builds trust and allows for peers to build a more solid working relationship.  (Link to feedback best practice)

Operationalise: 
- We will commit to providing direct, constructive feedback to our colleagues in our work to achieve the mission of the Green Software Foundation.
- We will commit to following the 4A’s in our feedback process: 
  - Aim to assist (when giving feedback)  
  - Make the feedback actionable (when giving feedback) 
  - Be appreciative (when receiving feedback) 
- Accept or discard, and share decision with the giver (when receiving feedback) 

# Engage with Empathy 
Ensuring that all of our members and contributors feel that they can actively contribute will ensure that we create an environment that promotes belonging and will lead to better outcomes that are aligned with the core mission of the Green Software Foundation. 

Operationalise: 
- We will endeavour to listen actively before we respond, to recognize when other group members are not participating, and make space for them to engage.
- We will acknowledge that everyone is at a different stage on their climate learning and contribution journey and we will work to help our peers advance in their understanding and efforts to create impact aligned with the mission of the Foundation.

# Be Inclusive and Open to All
Achieving the mission of the Green Software Foundation requires us to be inclusive of diverse perspectives.  

Operationalise: 
- We will encourage and facilitate participation from members and contributors representing diverse sectors, industries, and regions, throughout the organization’s internal and external engagements.

# Ensure Accessibility
Digital accessibility is fundamental to achieving our vision of a future of low-carbon software. 

Operationalise: 
- We will ensure digital accessibility throughout our organizational processes, communications channels, standard development, and code.
